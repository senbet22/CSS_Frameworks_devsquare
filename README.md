# CSS Frameworks ‚Äì Social Media Application

## Project Overview:

This project is a client-side social media application built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and **Vite** (Multi-Page Application mode).  
The app allows users to perform full **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their posts, as well as interact socially with other users through features like:

- Following / unfollowing users
- Commenting on posts
- Reacting to posts with emojis

The focus was on **app logic first**, with styling applied later.
